# HIV-AIDS-North-America-Project
Web scraping for articles for HIV and AIDS in North American newspapers. 
Here is how we are going to approach the project. Its roughly divided into 3 parts, each stage needs to be completed in its entirety in order to proceed with the next one. The subtasks can run in parallel though. 

So, we will start with stage 1. Also for those who can are intrestrested in analysis may start the literature survey subtask as well. For newspapers, chose top 5 or top 10 national newspapers from  the North America region and start scraping for the following: ( from 2000 to 2018) 
	• Headline 
	• Date of publication
	• Name of newspaper of publication
	• Region of origin ( i.e. Where is the news being reported from) 
	• Body of the article
	
Output should be in csv or sheet with appropriate column headers. Whatever you code, please add proper comments for better understanding; if in case you making any assumptions then attach proper explanation for the same. Add code under the folder of your name on GitHub.
